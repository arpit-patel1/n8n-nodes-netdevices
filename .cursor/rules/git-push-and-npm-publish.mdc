When the user says git push and publish, perform the following actions in order:
	1.	Ensure there are no linting errors (e.g., run npm run lint and confirm it passes).
	2.	Build the project using npm run build.
	3.	Commit any pending changes and push to the main branch.
	4.	Increment the patch version in package.json using npm version patch.
	5.	Push commits and tags to Git: git push && git push --tags.
	6.	Publish the package to npm using npm publish.
